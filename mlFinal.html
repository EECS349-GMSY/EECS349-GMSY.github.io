    <h3> The Problem </h3>
       <p> Our task is to predict the number of people at the gym based on attributes of the weather, along with date, time, and position in the school quarter. 
        The task is important because it will allow students to better plan when to go to the gym, and predict if they will have access to machinery at the gym at certain times. This will save students time and allow them to have more efficient workouts. 
       </p>
    <h3> The Solution </h3>
       <p> describe your solution in high level terms (what kind of learner(s) did you use, what types of features did you use) 
       </p>
    <h3> Testing and Training </h3>
       <p> describe how you tested and trained it (what your dataset was, how you measured success) 
       </p>
    <h3> Results </h3>
       <p> Describe the key results (how well your solution performed in no more thana paragraph, along with your key findings, e.g. the most important features for the task)
