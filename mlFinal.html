    <h3> The Problem </h3>
       <p> Northwestern University's largest gym is Henry Crown Sports Pavilion, further referenced to as HCSP. At times, HCSP can be very crowded, and certain types of equipment, for example treadmills or squat racks, may not be available based on the number of people at the gym. It is often frustrating when you plan to do a workout at the gym but get there and find that all the necessary equipment is taken.

       </p>
    <h3> The Solution </h3>
        <p> 
          Our goal was to write a ML algorithm that would estimate the number of people at the gym at a given time in the future. This would be allow people to make a more informed decision about whether to go to the gym or not, based on their specific needs.

          We narrowed the main factors affecting the number of people at the gym to the following:

        After acquiring the above data, we wrote a python script to compile it into a .csv file that Weka could interpret. We then entered the training/testing phase where we iteratively found the best format for our .csv file.

    <h3> Testing and Training </h3>
       <p> describe how you tested and trained it (what your dataset was, how you measured success) 
       </p>
    <h3> Results </h3>
      <p> Describe the key results (how well your solution performed in no more thana paragraph, along with your key findings, e.g. the most important features for the task) </p>
